Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?

Here‚Äôs my semi-boring story on why I decided to push myself outside my comfort zone with this Software Engineering course..üòÇ

I come from a place where ‚Äòdreams‚Äô aren‚Äôt taken seriously and anything that is outside the expected norm of the ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù career paths are considered somewhat of a taboo, so to say. There was absolutely no way I was spending an extra 10 years in school to become a doctor, or reading stacks of books so I can judge people (they are great professions by the way, just not for me). Anyways I digress, let's get to the point.

I pride myself in defying the odds and I have decided to make it my mission(I mean who else would do this for me) to make sure I accomplish most if not all the goals I have set for myself. 

Four years ago, i stumbled on programming languages after years of playing online hacking games and decided that coding was something that would become a long term interest of mine. I took it upon myself to learn how to code and signed up on platforms such as Khan Academy & Code Academy, which gave me basic knowledge but that wasn't enough. I Wanted more.

We live in a digital age where technology is dynamically and increasingly contributing to the success of business globally. Within the business environment, the role of technology is significant as it is integrated into all departments. Digital material is increasingly shaping the way we communicate, the way we interact, the way we consume media and the way we share information. Unfortunately though, aside from media consumption, a lot of 3rd world countries are lagging behind, and I come from one of those. 

As much as i can say that i have always been interested in the way things work, i can say that i'm more interested in why they don't. I believe that tech can mitigate if not completely fix a lot of problems for third world countries. Technology is actually fast tracking Africa specifically and it is evident. With a bigger force though and tech heads like myself banding together I believe we will be able to create solutions that will enable us to jump leaps a lot faster than developed countries and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. For Example, Nigeria has one of the tightest banking security infrastructures in the world because of the problems we face around 3rd party interference. So we may lag in some areas but that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a huge gap that needs to be filled

That‚Äôs why I decided to push myself with Software Engineering. I want to be one of the people that can bring about great change and spearhead innovative solutions to help my country move forward. Yes, this is only a portion of the work as there is a lot to be done. However, I think that it will be an impactful contribution and I‚Äôm excited for the journey ahead. Thanks, to globalization, technology impacts not just business but everyday life

I hope you enjoyed my little story. I will be back to fill you in on the great things I would‚Äôve accomplished in give or take a couple of years üòÅ
