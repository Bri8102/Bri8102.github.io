If you're thinking from the look of the title that i'm going to go on a mini rant, well.....you're not completely wrong. But not all rants are negative.

It was really these rails for me. Working on this Rails Project has further solidified my knowledge of the inner-workings of web applications; all the progress i was hoping for, finally came through. 

I kind of have a mild obsession with TO DO LIST applications and thought, i might as well learn how to make one since i use them alot and so i did. I started by mapping out my relationships(see below), with my Join Table being Lists.

With this, i was able to successful build out my associations and use nested routes to get my app functioning. However, where it all started to go downhill was when i introduced OminAuth into the mix. This quickly became a 2 day stretch consisting of endless headaches, frustration, a mix of many overwhelming emotions to say the least as i couldn't just figure out what i was doing wrong. Keep in mind that i didn't use Devise, which made it a little more difficult as the instructions for set up were a little different from using OmniAuth coupled with devise.
